# {frontmatter.title}

## 1. what even is Haskell

about Haskell being an FP language

### 1.1 the useful aspects of using Haskell

Haskell pushing you towards good habits...

### 1.2 the annoying bits...

Haskell making some things a bit too hard to accomplish.

## 2. is Haskell used in production?

Sometimes.

## 3. Why you should still learn Haskell

### 3.1 Learn good habits

pushing side effects to the edges of the program, immutability, thinking about data manipulation in

### 3.2 Expanding your horizon

Probably a good thing to just learn different things from time to time

### 3.3 Using these concepts in other projects as well
