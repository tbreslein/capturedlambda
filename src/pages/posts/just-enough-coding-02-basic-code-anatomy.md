# Just enough coding, part 2 - Basic code anatomy

## 0. previously...

... we looked at what programs and processes from a user perspective are, and how they interact with an operating system.

2. "having only intrinsic form with little or no attempt at pictorial representation or narrative content"

### 1.1 Machine readable vs human readable

### 1.2 Machine instructions

## 2. The classic "Hello world!" program

### 2.1 Functions

### 2.1 ... in C

### 2.3 ... in Python

## Conclusion
