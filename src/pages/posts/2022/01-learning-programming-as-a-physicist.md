# Learning programming as a physicist

> ... and why it doesn't make you a software engineer.

foo ~bar~ baz

## 1. Programming in physics

### 1.1 what do physicists need programming for

simulations, data reduction, ...

example:

~~~typescript
const x = 1.0;
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log("i");
}
~~~

### 1.2 the average curriculum

at best one basics course + numerical programming

### 1.3 is it enough?

probably not.

## 2. switching jobs

if, like me, you want to leave academia for a dev position

### 2.1 discipline

keep. learning. and try not to skip 'hard' topics

### 2.2 dive into the essentials: compiling, toolchains, data structures, algos, ...

actually learn what a compiler does, at least in principle, learn how to use tools like cmake, learn
actual data structures and algorithms...

### 2.3 languages

broaden your horizon a bit: something like C, something like Python, probably javascript, maybe
Haskell...

### 2.4 sources and practice

books, codewars

### 2.5 learn modern tools (shell, git)

for christ's sake, please learn git and BASIC shell scripting
