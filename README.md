# Captured Lambda

A little blog from a dude that got a master's in astrophysics, but then decided to turn to software
development.
It's also simply my foray into using `svelte` and `astro`.

## What the blog is about

The blog is probably mostly going to be programming focused, but therein the topics are going to be
whatever I want to rant or swoon about.
The first post is already a rant, and who knows what the next is going to be.

The main goal of this blog is just for me the sort my thoughts, and writing them down as always been
a big help for me.
If someone else can also learn from it or something, all the better.

I might share little things I developed in my projects, maybe share bigger things about those
projects, or something like that.
I am about to start developing an android app soon (hopefully), and I can see myself writing about
it here, to document my journey.
